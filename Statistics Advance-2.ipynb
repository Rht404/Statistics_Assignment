    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables and provides the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. It is a function p(x) that gives the probability that a discrete random variable X is equal to some value 𝑥 i.e. p(X=x)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF would give the probability of each outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6), which is p(X=x)=1/6 for each x.\n",

    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF is used for continuous random variables and describes the likelihood of the variable taking on a specific value. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not give probabilities directly but rather the relative likelihood; probabilities are found by integrating the PDF over an interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The height of adults can be modeled using a normal distribution. The PDF of this normal distribution gives the relative likelihood of an individual being of a specific height. For example, the height of a randomly selected person might have a PDF value, which gives the relative likelihood of observing that specific height."
